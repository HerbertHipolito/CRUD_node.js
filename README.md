# CRUD_node.js

This project shows a simple CRUD I developed using node.js and MongoDB. Therefore, this application manages a product dataset so you can create, read, update and delete products and their traits such as product name, description, stock and price. These features can be used by clicking on the above buttons.

I created mainly it to demonstrate my basic knowledge about Back-End development, more specifically node.js and non-relational databases that I have been studying for a few weeks. As my first project, there is nothing complex and different here from most applications around the internet. However, I am super attracted and fascinated by this area and I intend to go deeper into my studies and build more robust applications.
